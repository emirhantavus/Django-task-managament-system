# üìù Task Management System

This project is a Task Management System developed using Django Rest Framework (DRF). It allows users to create projects, add tasks, and assign these tasks to specific users. Role-based access controls enable managing user permissions effectively.

## üöÄ Project Features

- **Create, list, and update projects and tasks:** Users can manage projects and related tasks with ease.
- **Role-based authorization:** Two roles are defined: Project Manager and Developer. Project Managers can create and manage tasks and projects, while Developers can only update and view tasks.
- **Assign tasks to multiple users:** Tasks can be assigned to multiple users for collaborative work.
- **Scheduled tasks using Celery and Redis:** Tasks can be scheduled for specific times, and notifications can be sent before deadlines.

## üì¶ Technologies Used

- **Django 5.0.1** - Web framework used for developing the backend.
- **Django Rest Framework (DRF)** - For building and consuming RESTful APIs.
- **PostgreSQL** - Database for storing user, project, and task data.
- **Redis** - In-memory data structure store used for background tasks and queue management.
- **Celery** - Asynchronous task management and scheduling.
- **Postman** - For API testing and documentation.
- **Git and GitHub** - Version control and code repository.

## üìö Development Approaches

### ‚úÖ Test-Driven Development (TDD)
Test-Driven Development (TDD) was implemented to ensure code quality and reliability.

- **Test Cases Include:**
  - Testing user and role creation.
  - Testing project and task creation with validation checks.
  - Testing API endpoints for authorized and unauthorized access.

### üåê Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles were used to create a clear separation between the business logic and technical concerns.

- **Domain Models:**
  - `User`: Custom user model with roles.
  - `Project`: Represents a project entity with relationships to tasks and users.
  - `Task`: Represents a task entity with relationships to users and projects.
